    <h1>DECON Autonomous Disinfection Unit</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        For the DECON project, our goal is to create an autonomous robotic
        platform that can safely disinfect high risk areas/items in public spaces of healthcare facilities
        , such as doorknobs, handlebars, light-switches, etc., to mitigate the risk
        of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs), all without disrupting
        regular healthcare workflow and traffic. To achieve this, our team
        designed a robotic platform proof-of-concept prototype that autonomously navigates itself
        between fixed ROIs, identifies target disinfection with computer vision
        , and executes a disinfectant spray and UVC radiation disinfection
        routine on fixed objects (doorknobs and light-switches), specifically targeting 
        Methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is one of the largest contributors to HAIs.
