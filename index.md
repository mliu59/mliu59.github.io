## Miles Liu

Hello! My name is Miles Liu. I recently graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and I am currently working towards a Master of Science in Engineering in Robotics at the [JHU Laboratory for Computational and Sensory Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/), expecting to graduate in 2022.

I concurrently work as an Engineering Associate with the amazing team at the startup company [ClearMask, LLC](https://www.theclearmask.com/), where my main responsibilities include development, testing, and maintenance of new products, external webpages, and internal digital platforms.

# Here is my public project portfolio:

* Autonomous Vehicle Testing Asset (VTA)
  * Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project, Sponsored by [Oceaneering International, Inc.](https://www.oceaneering.com/)
  * An autonomous surface vehicle that serves as a tether management system to mitigate tether tension for Oceaneering’s small subsea vehicles during vehicle testing and deployment.
  * Our team was awarded Best Presentation by a panel of ASME judges.
* Biaxial Stretcher for Biogels
  * [Nguyen Laboratory](https://engineering.jhu.edu/tnguy108/) for Mechanics of Soft Adaptive Materials
  * A custom biaxial stretcher device for cell-seeded biogels, used for investigating mechanical and structural behavior of astrocyte cells under mechanical straining.
* DECON Autonomous Disinfection Unit
  * [Leading Innovation Design Team](https://engineering.jhu.edu/lindt/) Project
  * A mobile autonomous robot platform that identifies and safely disinfects contamination hot spots in healthcare facilities.
* Wikipedia Speedruns (Ongoing): <https://wikispeedruns.com/>
  * Inspired by a number of fun online tournaments we’ve held over a few months, Wikipedia Speedruns is a web-page game where players try to get from one wikipedia page to another as fast as possible using only links in the article. The project is currently in a MVP state, and there are a number of big game features we are aiming to add soon.

Beyond academics, I am also involved in JHU’s Chinese Students Association, where I served as the club’s co-president from 2020-2021 and as committee directors from 2018-2020. I am also involved in the [THREAD](https://www.thread.org/) mentoring program as Head of Family since 2018.
