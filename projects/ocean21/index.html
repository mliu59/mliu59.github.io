        <p>
          For my MechE Senior Design project, our team (OCEAN21) was tasked by
          our sponsors,
          <a href="https://www.oceaneering.com/"
            >Oceaneering International, Inc.</a
          >, to design an autonomous surface vehicle that can track and follow
          small underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicle) during vehicle
          deployment testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve this, our team designed, built, and tested a prototype
          vehicle testing asset (VTA) that is conveniently deployable, low cost,
          and can actively track and follow a tethered underwater vehicle in
          open water deployment environments. The VTA tracks and follows the ROV
          using both an autopilot system coupled with ROV vehicle state data
          stream, as well as a mechanical solution utilizing tether tension to
          estimate relative ROV positions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final Spring semester prototype outperformed a previous benchmark
          solution by <strong>75%-90%</strong> in its performance metric
          (average tether tension reduction) under various operating conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team was also awarded Best Presentation Award by a panel of ASME
          judges for our year end presentation.

            src="https://mliu59.github.io/projects/ocean21/tethertension.png"

            The goal of the VTA is to mitigate the tension exerted on the ROV by the surface vehicle
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          As motivation for the project, long range operations of ROVs commonly
          require long fiber cables for tele-operation and data transfer, since
          wireless connections are less than ideal underwater. A surface vehicle
          or floating device attached to the ROV with a shorter fixed length
          tether can serve as a wireless data relay and tether management system
          for the ROV. However, it can hinder the ROV's maneuverability, since
          the ROV has to drag the surface vehicle along with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          By adding autonomous navigation capabilities to the surface vehicle,
          we can actively keep it within a certain threshold distance from the
          underwater ROV, to ensure that the connected tether is never taut,
          thus mitigating the tether tension that we are trying to reduce.
        </p>

        <p>
          Small ROV vehicle testing is usually conducted in a medium-sized lake, 
          which can have some mild wind and wave forces to consider (Sea-state 0), but our
          sponsors were also eager to potentially use the vehicle in more turbulent conditions
          in open seas.

        <p>
          For the mechanical design, the vehicle is built from standard 80-20
          T-slotted frames and PVC pipes for modularity during the prototyping
          process, measuring 40"x32"x20" and 45 lbs. The vehicle's underwater load-cell and thrusters
          are mounted on pivot structures to allow for compact storage and
          transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vehicle is powered with
          2 underwater thrusters running at 20V, with battery capacity to enable
          6 hour operations. 
        </p>

        <p>
          For the vehicle's control system, there are two main objectives:
          tracking of the ROV, and active navigation to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          To track the ROV, the main approach is to establish a data-stream for
          the ROV's vehicle state from Oceaneering's separate ROV control
          system, including vehicle coordinates, depth, and speed. From there,
          waypoint commands can be given to the VTA for it to continuously
          predict the ROV's trajectory and follow the ROV, utilizing its own onboard GPS, 
          IMU, compass, etc.  
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in rare
          scenarios in which data transfer fails, the VTA is equipped with an
          onboard custom load cell to measure tether tension and angle when it
          is taut. The VTA can then estimate the ROV's relative position and
          perform navigation. This system can operate independent from ground control commands, 
          allowing it to operate in turbulent sea conditions that can interrupt wireless communication.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For the vehicle's navigation, high level commands such as waypoint are
          sent from the command station via radio. They are then processed and
          executed by a PixHawk 4 autopilot module installed with a modified
          ArduPilot autopilot software. Low level motor commands are then passed
          to an Arduino and then to motor controllers for actuation.
