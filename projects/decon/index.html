      <h1>DECON Autonomous Disinfection Unit</h1>

      <p>
        For the DECON project, our goal is to create a proof-of-concept autonomous robotic
        platform that can safely disinfect high risk areas/items in healthcare facilities to mitigate the risk of Healthcare Associated
        Infections (HAIs) without disrupting regular healthcare workflow. To achieve this, our team designed a 
        prototype that autonomously navigates itself between
        fixed ROIs, identifies target disinfection with computer vision, and
        executes a disinfectant spray and UVC radiation disinfection routine on
        fixed objects. The project is a course project
        for Leading Innovation Design Team, and was
        sponsored by the
        <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/"
          >Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory</a
        >.

        <!--At the time of participation, I was a Mechanical Engineering
        undergraduate junior just starting a robotics curriculum, so I had
        limited opportunities to contribute efficiently to some of the robot
        subsystems. However, looking back, tThe DECON project was an amazing
        learning experience for me. As my first year long robotics design
        project, being able to contribute to a sponsored real-world and highly
        relevant project-->The DECON project has
        taught me great deals in communication, project time & resource
        management, and working in highly multidisciplinary teams. On top of
        those, I was able to learn first hand the applications of various
        robotic sensors & actuators, navigational and computational strategies, and core robotic system
        components.

        The robotic system is mainly divided into three main operational
        subsystems:
        <strong>Navigation, Detection, Disinfection. </strong>Robot operation is
        implemented through ROS (Robot Operating System).
      </p>

      <div class="imgright">

          width="200"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        For <strong>Navigation</strong>, the robot relies on a LiDAR and SLAM to
        navigate in a dynamic environment like that of a healthcare facility. We used a
        <a href="https://www.robotis.us/turtlebot-3-waffle-pi/"
          >Robotis TurtleBot3 Waffle</a
        >
        as our base robot chassis.
      </p>
      
      

      <p>
        For <strong>Detection</strong>, we want the robot to be able to
        identify, categorize, and localize disinfection targets (in our
        prototype setup: doorknobs and light-switches) within a specified ROI,
        after the robot has navigated to the general area.
      </p>

      <div class="imgright">
        <img
          src="objectdetection.png"
          width="400"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        To do this, we used a Zed stereo camera for object detection and
        localization. A Faster RCNN algorithm trained on the Open Images dataset
        from Google, augmented with our own target images, is used to recognize
        and categorize objects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For <strong>Disinfection</strong>, to eliminate MRSA and other bacterium, we deployed a combined
        disinfection approach, using both commercial disinfectant spray delivered through a peristaltic
        pump and an electronically controlled sprayer, as well
        as a UVC LED array emitting 250-260 nm wavelength UV light for
        disinfection to deactivate bacterial DNA.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To ensure safety, the entire disinfection system is contained within a
        disinfection cone, mounted on a 5-DoF robotic arm. The disinfectant
        sprayer is placed at the base of the cone, and the UVC LEDs are radially
        positioned around the cone. The cone itself is reflective on the inside
        to maximize the amount of UVC delivered to the object surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, we were able to develop a prototype that was able to
        navigate in a controlled environment, identify a subset of target
        objects, and perform the disinfection routine.
