        <h1>DECON Autonomous Disinfection Unit</h1>
        <h3>August 2019 - June 2020</h3>

        <div class="pt-3"></div>

        <p>
          For the DECON project, our goal is to create a proof-of-concept
          autonomous robotic platform that can safely disinfect high risk
          areas/items in healthcare facilities to mitigate the risk of
          Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) without disrupting regular
          healthcare workflow. To achieve this, our team's goal is to design a proof-of-concept prototype
          that can autonomously navigate itself between fixed ROIs, identify
          target disinfection with computer vision, and execute a disinfectant
          spray and UVC radiation disinfection routine on fixed objects. The
          project is a course project for Leading Innovation Design Team, and
          was sponsored by the
          <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/"
            >Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our team was able to develop a prototype that was able to
          navigate in a controlled environment, identify a subset of target
          objects, and perform the disinfection routine.

          The robotic system is mainly divided into three main operational
          subsystems:
          <strong>Navigation, Detection, Disinfection. </strong>Robot operation
          is implemented through ROS (Robot Operating System).
        </p>

        <div class="imgright">
          <img src="DWA.png" width="200" />
        </div>
        <p>
          For <strong>Navigation</strong>, the robot relies on a LiDAR and SLAM
          to navigate in a dynamic environment like that of a healthcare
          facility. We used a
          <a href="https://www.robotis.us/turtlebot-3-waffle-pi/"
            >Robotis TurtleBot3 Waffle</a
          >
          as our base robot chassis.
        </p>

        <p>
          For <strong>Detection</strong>, we want the robot to be able to
          identify, categorize, and localize disinfection targets (in our
          prototype setup: doorknobs and light-switches) within a specified ROI,
          after the robot has navigated to the general area.
        </p>

        <div class="imgright">
          <img src="objectdetection.png" width="400" />
        </div>

        <p>
          To do this, we used a Zed stereo camera for object detection and
          localization. A Faster RCNN algorithm trained on the Open Images
          dataset from Google, augmented with our own target images, is used to
          recognize and categorize objects.
        </p>

        <p>
          For <strong>Disinfection</strong>, to eliminate MRSA and other
          bacterium, we deployed a combined disinfection approach, using both
          commercial disinfectant spray delivered through a peristaltic pump and
          an electronically controlled sprayer, as well as a UVC LED array
          emitting 250-260 nm wavelength UV light for disinfection to deactivate
          bacterial DNA.
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure safety, the entire disinfection system is contained within a
          disinfection cone, mounted on a 5-DoF robotic arm. The disinfectant
          sprayer is placed at the base of the cone, and the UVC LEDs are
          radially positioned around the cone. The cone itself is reflective on
          the inside to maximize the amount of UVC delivered to the object
          surface.
