        <h1>Sanaria Mosquito Dissection Robot (Ongoing)</h1>

        <p>
          The Sanaria Mosquito Dissection Robot is current my MSE research
          project at the
          <a href="https://ciis.lcsr.jhu.edu/doku.php"
            >JHU Computer Integrated Interventional Systems Laboratory</a
          >. The robot our team is designing aims to significantly improve the
          efficiency of a mosquito salivary gland extraction microdissection
          process, which is currently a completely manual procedure. The
          extracted glands are used for the production of the PfSPZ malaria
          vaccine by
          <a href="https://sanaria.com/">Sanaria, Inc.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Operationally, the goal of the system is such that the operator would only need to
          place mosquitos onto the loading area of the system, and the robot
          would take care of the rest. The operator would
          not need extensive microdissection training.  
        </p>

        <p>
          The robot platform performs this microdissection procedure through a
          number of high level steps. It first detects, picks, and properly
          places the mosquito for decapitation. It then decapitates the mosquito
          to expose the salivary gland. The salivary is then extracted with a
          squeeze and suction collection process. These steps are performed at
          separate workstations, located along a circular turntable, as seen on
          the right.
        </p>



        <p>
          The system performs a number of computer vision subroutines for
          localization of mosquito anatomy, and uses ROS (Robot Operating
          System) for high level system control and simulation for remote
          development. The most recent prototype of the system was able to
          achieve a <strong>93% robotic mosquito manipulation</strong> and
          <strong>87.1% salivary gland collection</strong> success rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Current work on the system involves repeated testing and refining of
          existing manipulation hardware systems, increasing computer vision
          reliability through the development of a machine learning model,
          implementing a control scheme for efficiently processing multiple
          mosquitos at once, and developing user operation tools for the system
          to be deployable.
