        <p>
          Wikipedia is a core informational service that a lot of people rely on
          to gather basic information on various topics. Building upon the
          interconnectedness of the platform, Wikispeedruns is an online
          open-source competitive game that challenges players to utilize their
          common trivia knowledge to quickly form connections between seemingly
          disjointed topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core objective of the game is to navigate from one wikipedia page
          to another in as few clicks/little time as possible by only clicking
          on links to other wikipedia articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 4/5/2022, we have over <b>1.8k</b> registered users, and nearly
          <b>70k</b>
          completed games on our game, with the past one or two months seeing
          the most exponential growth.

          This project is one of my favorite personal projects, as I've been
          able to work with a great team of experienced developers to work on a
          creative and exciting game with a rapidly growing community.

      <h3>Recapping previous work and todo list</h3>
      <p>
        On a core gameplay level, through previously play-testing and manual tournaments, we eventually determined that the game was not
        challenging enough. While increasing the specificity and niche-ness of
        the articles involved does increase the difficulty, on many occasions it
        rendered some prompts unplayable. For that reason, we decided to cut out
        a number of sections on Wikipedia pages that allowed for quick routes
        within similar subjects, such as disambiguation pages, category pages,
        See also sections, just to name a few, in order to make navigating the wikipedia articles more challenging, since players can then only rely on the text context of the articles. 
      </p>
      <p>
          In April, we were able to get a solid MVP of the website running. Players can choose specific prompts to play, and after they've finished, they can submit their results to an arcade style leaderboard.
      </p>
        <p>
          This project is particularly exciting because of the endless possibilities for features that can be implemented. Here are some core features that we are planning on implementing soon:
          <ul>
              <li>
                  <strong>A player account login system</strong>. Having this implemented can introduce another set of possibilities for game features, such as:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Player ranking system (Similar to Chess ELO and competitive online gaming ranking systems), and subsequently provide players incentive to practice and get better</li>
                      <li>Player history tracking, to make sure players don't flood the leaderboard with repeated tries of the same prompt</li>
                      <li>Player Achievements, to reward players with their progress and provide incentive for them to "achievement hunt"</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Synced</strong> (or pseudo-synced) <strong>live versus matches</strong>. The current game is not synchronized between players in that players can play and submit scores any time they would like. Having live versus matches implemented can be great for small scale tournaments or for hosting in-person events/competitions. 

              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Random prompt generator</strong>. Currently the game require administrators to manually put in prompts. In the future we would like to have a system that can automatically generate prompts whenever queried.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Article Categorization</strong>. It would be really cool to be able to categorize articles. Then we would be able to have the random prompt generator generate specifically themed prompts for events. With the user account system, the categorizer would also be able to provide user insight information on which subjects/topics their strengths and weaknesses lie depending on their past performances.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Path finding web crawler</strong>. Along with the prompt generator, the crawler would preemptively determine whether or not a prompt is even possible, and if it is, what the shortest path(s) between the articles are. This is actually a much trickier problem to solve, given that we'd implemented rules to disallow certain sections, so whatever implementation method we decide to use will need to also be able to filter out those disallowed links.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cool visualization stuff for showing everyone's path in a prompt.</strong> 
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>General UI improvements.</strong> 
              </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
