    <h1>Miles Liu</h1>

    <section>
        <p>Hello! My name is Miles Liu. I recently graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Mechanical
            Engineering, and I am currently working towards a Master of Science in Engineering in Robotics at the <a
                href="https://lcsr.jhu.edu/">JHU
                Laboratory for Computational and Sensory Robotics</a>, expecting to graduate in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>I currently work as an Engineering Associate with the amazing team at the startup company <a
                href="https://www.theclearmask.com/">ClearMask,
                LLC</a>, where my main responsibilities include development, testing, and
            maintenance of new products, external webpages, and internal digital platforms.

        <h3>Personal Project Portfolio:</h3>
        
        <h4><a href="https://www.connectsonder.com/">SONDER</a></h4>
        <p>SONDER is a crowd-sourced experience sharing network to help facilitate connection and experience sharing between university students.
            The network is built to fill in gaps in university advising by introducing wide range of student perspectives to help inform individual decisions.
            The project website is linked above. 
        </p>
        
        <h4><a href="https://mliu59.github.io/wikispeedruns.html">Wikipedia Speedruns</a> (Ongoing): <a
                href="https://wikispeedruns.com">https://wikispeedruns.com</a></h4>
        <p>Wikipedia Speedruns is a webpage game where players try to get from one wikipedia page to another as fast as possible using only
            links in the wikipedia articles.</p>
        <p>The project is currently in a MVP state, and there are a number of big game features will be added very soon. </p>
