    <h1>Miles Liu</h1>

    <section>
        <p>Hello! My name is Miles Liu. I recently graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Mechanical
            Engineering, and I am currently working towards a Master of Science in Engineering in Robotics at the <a
                href="https://lcsr.jhu.edu/">JHU
                Laboratory for Computational and Sensory Robotics</a>, expecting to graduate in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>I concurrently work as an Engineering Associate with the amazing team at the startup company <a
                href="https://www.theclearmask.com/">ClearMask,
                LLC</a>, where my main responsibilities include development, testing, and
            maintenance of new products, external webpages, and internal digital platforms.
        </p>

                    Inc.</a></li>
            <li>An autonomous surface vehicle that serves as a tether management system to mitigate tether tension for
                Oceaneering’s small subsea vehicles during vehicle testing and deployment.
            </li>
            <li>Our team was awarded Best Presentation by a panel of ASME judges.</li>

                Materials
            </li>
            <li>A custom biaxial stretcher device for cell-seeded biogels, used for investigating mechanical and
                structural
                behavior of astrocyte cells under mechanical straining.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4><a href="https://mliu59.github.io/decon.html">DECON Autonomous Disinfection Unit</a></h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Inspired by a number of fun online tournaments we’ve held over a few months, Wikipedia Speedruns is a
                web-page game where players try to get from one wikipedia page to another as fast as possible using only
                links in the article. The project is currently in a MVP state, and there are a number of big game
                features
                we are aiming to add soon.
